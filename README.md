## Overview

We are tasked to build help Roza's work with Improbable beef to find the elusive bacteria that brings the perfect beef taste. Using the dataset that collects microorganisms within human navels, We are to build a dashboard that would show both research participants and colleagues through access on a website what bacteria lives in their navels through a seleciton of ID along with some graphs. 

## Results

We displayed each key-value pair from the metadata sample to show the demographic information of the subject as well as using a drop down to allow us to select the various IDs. We also created a horizontal bar chart and a buble chart to display the data of the "Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found" and the "Bacteria Cultures Per Sample" In addition we created a gauge chart to show washing frequency of the subjects.
